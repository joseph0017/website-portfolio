          Thanks for getting this far, I graduated from the University of Benin(UNIBEN) with a B.Sc in architecture, and graduated from software engineering, Holberton school
          (cohort 9) with a specialization in frontend. I am however skilled in the backend as well. When I am not coding, you will often find me playing chess, as there
          is no other game I think I love more, and listening to music, or just playing video games.
